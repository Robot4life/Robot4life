# 🌽 NOT a Passionate Developer from a Crackhouse 🌽

Welcome to my silly little corner of the internet 😎💻✨  
Coding in C++ but dreaming in Comic Sans 😭💭

---

## 💻 Languages and Tools I Use to Pretend I Know What I’m Doing:
- 🧀 C++ (aka *See Plus Plus because I like extra credit*)
- 🧰 Copy → Paste → Pray
- 😩 Stack Overflow (my real BFF)
- ☕ Coffee-powered chaos

---

## 🧠 Current Mood:
> "Why write clean code when you can write emotional code?" 😭🫶  
> "It worked on my machine" – Me, professionally

---

## 🧪 Projects:
- ✨ World’s most unnecessary to-do app
- 🚀 Code that runs... eventually
- 🧃 100% juice, 0% documentation

---

## 🧹 Coding Philosophy:
- 💅 Semicolons are just spicy periods
- 🔥 If it crashes, it’s probably a feature
- 📉 Commit first, panic later

---

## 📫 Reach Me:
- 🕊️ Send me a message via pigeon or smoke signal
- 🧊 DMs colder than my CPU fan

---

## 👑 Final Words:
I’m not a “rockstar dev” — I’m more like a garage band coder with 2 brain cells and a dream 💭🔥  
✨ Be the segfault you wish to see in the world ✨
